The OpenAPI Specification (OpenAPI Spec) is the way we design, document, and consume our APIs. It's essentially a blueprint for your API, offering a clear, language-agnostic standard to describe the entirety of an API's operations. 
This means better collaboration, easier integration, and faster development cycles. ðŸš€

And for the Swift enthusiasts out there, there's something special: [Swift has introduced an OpenAPI Generator](https://www.swift.org/blog/introducing-swift-openapi-generator/). 
It's a fantastic tool that complements the power of OpenAPI Spec by streamlining the generation of client libraries, API stubs, and documentation. 
Definitely worth checking out!
