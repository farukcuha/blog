## As DJ Khalid would say, _"Another one!"_


There's something almost magical about the idea of building apps for devices for me personally. 
It's like you have this superpower to craft experiences that can fit right into the palm of someone's hand. 
The thought of creating a simple tool that makes daily tasks easier, anything on a device for me feels more fun.

Over the past year, I got a chance to work a few apps with these incredible developers that I now get to call my friends.
[Mirza](http://google.ca) and (Ahmet AKA Adam Driver)[], not kidding he basically is Adam Driver's twin brother.
