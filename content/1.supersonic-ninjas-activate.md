## TL;DR;

Follow along as we build and share our boilerplate starting point for all our mobile projects. We will build an API to power both an iOS and Android application that will include, user authentication, profile management and more.

By the end of this series, we will have 3 applications (Laravel API, iOS and Android applications) ready to kickstart your next project. 

## Let's Build Something Awesome Together

There's a kind of magic in crafting apps for devices, isn't there? It feels like wielding a superpower, shaping experiences that snugly fit into the palm of someone's hand. Whether it's whipping up a handy tool to simplify daily chores or anything that makes life a bit more fun on a device, it's always an adventure.

This past year, I've had the amazing opportunity to collaborate on several mobile apps with some incredible developers who've quickly become friends. Meet [Mirza](https://twitter.com/supersonicbyte) and [Ahmet](https://twitter.com/faruk__cuha)‚Äîand yes, Ahmet is practically Adam Driver's doppelganger in the flesh.

Throughout these projects, we've continually refined our app-building process and how we orchestrate the planning and crafting of API endpoints to fuel the applications. It's been a journey of iteration, collaboration, and lots of learning.

We've noticed the Laravel community could really benefit from more insights into this area. So, we decided to roll up our sleeves and share our "boilerplate" with you.

## What's in the Boilerplate?

Glad you asked (you did, right? üòè). Every app we develop shares a core set of functionalities. If you're familiar with [Laravel Jetstream](https://jetstream.laravel.com/introduction.html), you'll get the gist of what we're aiming for‚Äîa solid foundation for user experiences in web applications, but for native mobile apps.

Think user authentication, global event handling, in-app navigation, push notifications, and deep linking‚Äîall the essentials, really. We're crafting an iOS/Android "JetStream" to jumpstart your projects.

Alongside the [Laravel-powered](https://laravel.com) API, we're also sketching out an [OpenAPI Spec](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAPI_Specification). With the help of [Stoplight](https://stoplight.io/), we'll design, plan, and then implement our API, ensuring our build sticks closely to our initial blueprint.

## Why So Strict?

Both Swift and Kotlin don't mess around‚Äîthey demand precision in how JSON responses from an API are decoded. Every key must match its assigned type or be nullable. Missteps here lead to app crashes, so ensuring your API dishes out exactly what your app expects is crucial. 

## Our Ultimate Goal?

While I'll ([Yaz Jallad](https://twitter.com/ninjaparade)) primarily focus on Laravel, API intricacies, and a dash of iOS, [Mirza](https://twitter.com/supersonicbyte) will dive deep into iOS development. And ~Adam Driver~ [Ahmet Faruk √áuha](https://twitter.com/faruk__cuha) will guide us through Android and Kotlin.

Our hope? To arm you with three robust applications ready to kickstart your next project or to serve as a comprehensive learning tool. For me, this journey is about deepening my understanding and sharing those insights to solidify the concepts we explore, inviting feedback and learning from the community along the way.

We're setting our GitHub repositories to public, opening the floor for comments, contributions, or if you're just curious, a place for you to explore.

## Stack and Tools Overview

Here's a snapshot of the tech stack we're wielding for this series:
- **Back-End Magic**: [Laravel](https://laravel.com) with [Laravel Sail](https://laravel.com/docs/10.x/sail) and PHP 8.3
- **Data Storage**: [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org)
- **API Design**: [Stoplight](https://stoplight.io/)
- **API Testing**: [Postman](https://www.postman.com/)
- **iOS Development**: [Apple Xcode 15](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) and [Swift](https://developer.apple.com/swift/) 5.9
- **Android Development**: [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) and [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) (the Swift's cooler cousin, IMO).
- **EVERY THING EVER POSSIBLE**: [Sentry](https://sentry.io) the _only_ error and performance monitoring service you need for EVERY platform ever.
