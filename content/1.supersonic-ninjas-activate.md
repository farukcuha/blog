## As DJ Khalid would say, _"Another one!"_

There's something almost magical about the idea of building apps for devices for me personally. 
It's like you have this superpower to craft experiences that can fit right into the palm of someone's hand. 
The thought of creating a simple tool that makes daily tasks easier, anything on a device for me feels more fun.

Over the past year, I got a chance to work a few mobile apps with these incredible developers that I now get to call my friends.
[Mirza](https://twitter.com/supersonicbyte) and [Ahmet](https://twitter.com/faruk__cuha), not kidding he basically is Adam Driver's twin brother.
![Which one builds Android Apps?](which-is-which.png "Which is which")

During those builds, we've iterated on how we executed the build process for the apps, and how we coordinate the planning and building of the API endpoints to support the applications. 

Currently, in the Laravel community there is not a TON of content around this subject and because of that, we've decided to build and share what we call our "boilerplate" with you.

## What's included in the boilerplate?

I'm very glad you asked, you did ask right? ü•∑ 
Every app we build needs some common functionality. If you know [Laravel Jetstream](https://jetstream.laravel.com/introduction.html) you will be familiar with the basic building blocks you get to kickstart your users web experience.

From the Jetstream features, you will get an idea of the API we're going to build. Like any Web application user dashboard, every native mobile application has a very similar feature set.

For example, every app will have some level of user authentication for obtaining an API token, handling global events, in app navigation, push notifications and deep linking. In essence,  we will build out an iOS/Android "JetStream" starting point.

Along with building the [Laravel powered](https://laravel.com) API, we will also create an [OpenAPI Spec](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAPI_Specification). 
We will use tool called [Stoplight](https://stoplight.io/) to design and plan our API and then implement it from that spec which we will use to test our API implementation to ensure we are conforming to the contract we defined in the spec.

## WhY sO sTrIcT?

Both Swift and Kotlin are very type safe and require you to define how `json` responses you get from an API can be decoded. Each `key` in that response must adhere to a type or be nullable. Failing to provide the correct decoding strategy for a key will
result in a fatal error, so it's _really_ important to ensure the API responses you expect are actually the ones you are getting otherwise üí£üí£üí£.

## Over all Objective?
[While I](https://twitter.com/ninjaparade) will mostly focus on Laravel and the API and some iOS, [Mirza](https://twitter.com/supersonicbyte) will be sharing his vast knowledge on the iOS side and ~Ahmet~ [Adam Driver](https://twitter.com/faruk__cuha) will show the way on Android and Kotlin. 

In the end, we hope to have 3 applications ready start our next projects with or just use as a learning tool. The initiative for me, personally, is to learn and document my learning to help cement the concepts we discuss and hopefully learn from anyone reading the posts.

We want to have the github repositories we are working in to be public, so that will allow anyone to comment, contribute or just browse and lurk in the shadows.

## Stack and tools

Below is a final outline of all the tools we plan to use during this series.
- [Laravel](https://laravel.com) for the API
- [Laravel Sail](https://laravel.com/docs/10.x/sail) Laravel Sail and PHP 8.3
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org) for the "persistence layer" or Database 
- [Stoplight](https://stoplight.io/) for designing the API Spec
- [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) for hitting and testing our API in a client
- [Apple Xcode 15](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) for the iOS build
- [Swift](https://developer.apple.com/swift/) currently Swift 5.9
- [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) for the Android build
- [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) which is basically a less cool Swift if you ask me, just saying.
