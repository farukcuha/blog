## As DJ Khalid would say, _"Another one!"_


There's something almost magical about the idea of building apps for devices for me personally. 
It's like you have this superpower to craft experiences that can fit right into the palm of someone's hand. 
The thought of creating a simple tool that makes daily tasks easier, anything on a device for me feels more fun.

Over the past year, I got a chance to work a few mobile apps with these incredible developers that I now get to call my friends.
[Mirza](https://twitter.com/supersonicbyte) and [Ahmet](https://twitter.com/faruk__cuha), not kidding he basically is Adam Driver's twin brother.

During those builds, we've iterated on how we executed the build process for the apps, and how we coordinate the planning and building of the API endpoints to support the applications. 

Currently, in the Laravel community there is not a TON of content around this subject and because of that, we've decided to build and share what we call our "boilerplate" with you.

## What's included in the boilerplate?

Glad you asked. 
Every app we build needs a few common modules, if you know [Laravel Jetstream](https://jetstream.laravel.com/introduction.html) you will be familiar with the basics.
You can see a good summary of the API features we're going to build if you visit the Jetstream documentation. 

Along with building the API endpoints we will also create an [OpenAPI Spec](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAPI_Specification) to test our API to ensure we are conforming to the response contracts. 

## WhY sO sTrIcT?

Both Swift and Kotlin are very type safe and require you to define how `json` responses you get from an API can be decoded. Each `key` in that response must adhere to a type or be nullable. Failing to provide the correct decoding strategy for a key will
result in a fatal error so it's _really_ important to ensure the API responses you expect are actually the ones you are getting otherwise ðŸ’£ðŸ’£ðŸ’£.
