## Time to reveal the design

The first section of the mobile application that we will be developing is the basic flow for a user (existing) to login. 
This is critical to every application we've built as it is when the mobile application obtains the api token required to act on the user's behalf.
There is a lot of debate about OTP or "One time passwords" being bad and not providing a good UX, but we've built this feature out to ensure the user experience is seamless.

## Y no passwords?

For us, it's simple. It removes complexity. Here is why.
I've you've installed or used any Laravel starting boilerplate before you know you get the following flow.
- Registration
- Login
- Verify Password flow (optional)
- Request Password Reset
- Confirm Password Reset

This isn't a ton of code to maintain once you have your application live in production but the fact that the authentication requires password means you need to think 
passwords if you migrate.

## Real life example.

A previous client had been using a service that had thousands of customers already. To migrate them, the biggest concern was "how will they login again", since their passwords are on another service
encrypted in a manner we don't 100% know and wouldn't be able to just migrate over. Solution, who cares about the password, let them simply request a one time passcode to be sent to the email address they signed up with, and never think about that issue ever again. Problem solved.

## The Pros keep piling up.

In the previously mentioned flow with passwords, user registration and user login could both benefit from users verifying their email address. This is done by sending the user an email with a link. 
Once clicking the unique link the user is directed back to your web application where the user record is updated once the token is validated and found (simplifying here).

Well what if I told you the actual login process and registration process are handled with the same core logic.
When a user registers, the controller/code that handles this sign up will create the required records and then send them a *OTP* code to login. Once they log in by submitting the OTP code, we know they have a valid email address, we also know we can authenticate them.

PLUS, we do not have to maintain the request a new password flow or the update password flow AND we get the benefit of verifying our users emails at the same time.
