# Setting Up Environments in iOS: A Quick Guide

Managing different environments like development, staging, and production in your iOS app can be a breeze with the right setup. Let's dive into how we can make our app adaptable and easily switch between these modes.

## Step 1: The xcconfig Files

Much like the `.env` files you might be familiar with from web or backend development, `xcconfig` files serve a similar purpose in iOS. They allow you to define key-value pairs that can be used to configure your app's environment.

Start by creating a folder to house your `xcconfig` files. Then, navigate to File -> New -> File, and select `Configuration Settings File`.

Name it according to the environment it represents, such as `Dev.xcconfig` for the development environment.

Repeat this process for each environment you want to set up, such as `Staging.xcconfig` and `Production.xcconfig`.

## Step 2: Project Configuration

In your project settings, under the `Info` tab, you'll find a table named Configurations. This is where you'll link your `xcconfig` files to your project's configurations.

Duplicate the existing Debug and Release configurations for each additional environment. Be cautious as Debug and Release configurations have different build settings; Debug is for development, while Release is optimized for production builds.

Assign the corresponding `xcconfig` file to each configuration. For example, link `Dev.xcconfig` to both Dev Debug and Dev Release configurations.

## Step 3: The Schemes

Schemes in Xcode define how your app is built and run. You'll need a separate scheme for each environment.

Duplicate the default scheme and create a new one for each environment, naming them appropriately (e.g., `ProjectName-EnvironmentName`). In the scheme's settings, under the Build Configuration dropdown, select the appropriate configuration for the environment. For example, for a Staging scheme, select the Staging-Debug configuration for running the app and Staging-Release for archiving.

## Step 4: Reading & Setting the Environment

Now that the setup is complete, it's time to use the environment variables in your code. First, add a variable to your `xcconfig` files using the syntax `KEY = VALUE`.

To access these variables in your code, you'll need to expose them in your `Info.plist` file. Create a new dictionary entry in `Info.plist`, and inside it, add entries for each environment variable. The value should reference the variable in the `xcconfig` file, like `$(NAME_OF_YOUR_ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE)`.

![11.png](/11.png)![12.png](/12.png)

Here's a utility code snippet to read from the environment:

```swift
enum Environment {
    enum Error: Swift.Error {
        case missingKey, invalidValue, missingConfiguration
    }
    
    enum Keys: String {
        case apiBaseURL
    }
    
    private static let infoDictionaryKey = "Env"
    
    static func value<T: LosslessStringConvertible>(for key: Keys) -> T {
        do {
            let value: T = try value(for: key.rawValue)
            return value
        } catch let error {
            NSLog(error.localizedDescription)
            fatalError("\(key.rawValue) missing from Configuration")
        }
    }
    
    static func value<T: LosslessStringConvertible>(for key: String) throws -> T {
        guard let config = Bundle.main.object(forInfoDictionaryKey: infoDictionaryKey) as? [String: Any] else {
            throw Error.missingConfiguration
        }
        
        guard let object = config[key] else { throw Error.missingKey }
        
        switch object {
        case let value as T:
            return value
        case let string as String:
            guard let value = T(string) else { fallthrough }
            return value
        default:
            throw Error.invalidValue
        }
    }
    
    static var apiBaseURL: String {
        return value(for: Keys.apiBaseURL)
    }
}
```

This code retrieves the environment variables from the `Info.plist` file. Make sure the `infoDictionaryKey` and the keys in the `Keys` enum match the names in your `Info.plist`.

To test your setup, print the base URL in your `AppDelegate` or `App` struct (for SwiftUI) using `print(Environment.apiBaseURL)`. Run the app with different schemes to see the corresponding base URLs in the console.

## Bonus: Different Bundle Identifiers

You might want to use different bundle identifiers for different environments. To do this, go to your target's Build Settings, search for "bundle identifier," and set different identifiers for each environment.

With this setup, you can easily manage different environments in your iOS app, ensuring that it behaves correctly whether you're developing, testing, or releasing it
